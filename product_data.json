        "description": "When it comes to Renaissance Travertine, everyone who has worked in the stone industry is familiar with this pure work of nature. If you want the strongest travertine on the planet, or the whitest travertine on the planet, you should look for Renaissance Travertine in Iran. Renaissance travertine has the fewest holes of all travertines. It also comes in a variety of designs, including straight and circular veins. Straight veins create the popular travertine look, while wavey veins make excellent book-matches. And delivers a unique and unseen design which resembles a masterpiece.\nBright colors like white, light cream, or light beige are currently in high demand for facades and cladding in the United Arab Emirates. Because of the climate, it is best to use travertine so you never have to worry about color changes. When compared to other natural stones like marbles like Thassos or other white marbles, travertine can be the whitest natural stone used for exterior cladding because marbles are highly sensitive to sunlight and will lose their gloss and whiteness after a brief period of time if used for exterior cladding.",
